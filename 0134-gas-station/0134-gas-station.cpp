        If the total number of gas is bigger than 
        the total number of cost. 
        There must be a solution.
        
        Proof:
        http://blog.shengwei.li/leetcode-gas-station/
        - If there is only one gas station, it’s true.
        - If there are two gas stations a and b, and gas(a) cannot afford cost(a), i.e., gas(a) < cost(a), then gas(b) must be greater than cost(b), i.e., gas(b) > cost(b), since gas(a) + gas(b) > cost(a) + cost(b); so there must be a way too.
        - If there are three gas stations a, b, and c, where gas(a) < cost(a), i.e., we cannot travel from a to b directly, then:
        - either if gas(b) < cost(b), i.e., we cannot travel from b to c directly, then gas(c) > cost(c), so we can start at c and travel to a; since gas(b) < cost(b), gas(c) + gas(a) must be greater than cost(c) + cost(a), so we can continue traveling from a to b. **Key Point:** this can be considered as there is one station at c’ with gas(c’) = gas(c) + gas(a) and the cost from c’ to b is cost(c’) = cost(c) + cost(a), and the problem reduces to a problem with two stations. This in turn becomes the problem with two stations above.
        - or if gas(b) >= cost(b), we can travel from b to c directly. Similar to the case above, this problem can reduce to a problem with two stations b’ and a, where gas(b’) = gas(b) + gas(c) and cost(b’) = cost(b) + cost(c). Since gas(a) < cost(a), gas(b’) must be greater than cost(b’), so it’s solved too.
        - For problems with more stations, we can reduce them in a similar way. In fact, as seen above for the example of three stations, the problem of two stations can also reduce to the initial problem with one station.

                Proof: 
                http://blog.shengwei.li/leetcode-gas-station/
                say there is a point C between A and B -- that is A can reach C but cannot reach B. Since A cannot reach B, the gas collected between A and B is short of the cost. Starting from A, at the time when the car reaches C, it brings in gas >= 0, and the car still cannot reach B. Thus if the car just starts from C, it definitely cannot reach B.
